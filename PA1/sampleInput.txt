Hydro-slotted perforation<====>35087381<====>Hydro-slotted perforation Hydro-slotting perforation technology is the process of opening the productive formation through the casing and cement sheath to produce the oil or gas product flow (intensification, stimulation).

Social emotions<====>35090653<====>Social emotionsSocial emotions are emotions that depend upon the thoughts, feelings or actions of other people, "as experienced, recalled, anticipated or imagined at first hand".    Examples are embarrassment, guilt, shame, jealousy, envy, empathy, and pride.   In contrast, basic emotions such as happiness and sadness only require the awareness of one's own physical state.

Studies have found that children as young as 2 to 3 years of age can express emotions resembling guilt  and remorse.

Southern Daly languages<====>35094118<====>Southern Daly languages The Southern Daly languages are a proposed family of two distantly related Australian aboriginal languages.   They are: Murrinh-patha (Murinbata)Ngan’gityemerri (Ngan’gi)ClassificationSouthern Daly is a distant and problematic relationship. Murrinh-Patha was once thought to be an isolate, due to lexical data:  It has, at most, an 11-percent shared vocabulary with any other language against which it has been compared.   However, Murrinh-patha and Ngan’gityemerri correspond closely in their verbal inflections.  Green (2003) makes a case that the formal correspondences in core morphological sequences of their finite verbs are too similar (in their complexities and their irregularities) to have come about through anything other than a shared genetic legacy from a common parent language.

Moment closure<====>35097048<====>Moment closureIn probability theory, moment closure is an approximation method used to estimate moments of a stochastic process.IntroductionTypically, differential equations describing the i-th moment will depend on the (i + 1)-st moment.  To use moment closure, a level is chosen past which all cumulants are set to zero.  This leaves a resulting closed system of equations which can be solved for the moments.   The approximation is particularly useful in models with a very large state space, such as stochastic population models.  HistoryThe moment closure approximation was first used by Goodman  and Whittle   who set all third and higher-order cumulants to be zero, approximating the population distribution with a normal distribution.

Fenchel–Moreau theorem<====>35099255<====>Fenchel–Moreau theoremIn convex analysis, the Fenchel–Moreau theorem (named after Werner Fenchel and Jean Jacques Moreau) or Fenchel biconjugation theorem (or just biconjugation theorem) is a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be equal to its biconjugate.   This is in contrast to the general property that for any function  f^{**} \leq f .    This can be seen as a generalization of the bipolar theorem.    It is used in duality theory to prove strong duality (via the perturbation function). Statement of theoremLet  (X,\tau)  be a Hausdorff locally convex space, for any extended real valued function  f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}  it follows that  f = f^{**}  if and only if one of the following is true f  is a proper, lower semi-continuous, and convex function, f \equiv +\infty , or f \equiv -\infty .

Annulus (botany)<====>35103406<====>Annulus (botany)An annulus in botany is an arc or a ring of specialized cells on the sporangium.  These cells are arranged in a single row, and are associated with the release or dispersal of spores. FernsIn leptosporangiate ferns, the annulus located on the outer rim of the sporangium and serves in spore dispersal.  It consists typically of a ring or belt of dead water-filled cells with differentially thickened cell walls that stretches about two-thirds around each sporangium in leptosporangiate ferns.  The thinner walls on the outside allow water to evaporate quickly under dry conditions.  This dehiscence causes the cells to shrink and a contraction and straightening of the annulus ring, eventually rupturing the sporangial wall by ripping apart thin-walled lip cells on the opposite side of the sporangium.

Bell CriteriaAtypianoneminimal: smooth nuclei, smooth contours, minimal variation in nuclear size, shape, and evenly distributed chromatinmoderate: many large, plump, irregular nuclei, 1-2 mitotic figuressevere:  obvious pleomorphism, enlarged bizarre nuclei with dense chromatin, giant cells, often multinucleated, enlarged, atypical nucleoliMitotic figuresEvaluation of the mitotic figures in a STUMP requires evaluation of 3 specific criteriaHairy extensions of chromatin must be present, extending from a central clot-like dense mass of chromosomes. 

Bowman 45<====>35112941<====>Bowman 45 The Bowman 45 is an ocean-cruising yacht produced by Rustler Yachts of Falmouth.  The yacht is traditionally lined and styled, but is built from solid glassfibre composite with a fin and skeg underwater profile. To achieve a good seakeeping ability for ocean cruising, the yacht is heavily constructed, and well ballasted.  In addition, the yacht incorporates a strong skeg hung rudder.   The production of the yachts on a semi-custom basis, and the small numbers of yachts produced each year, result in a significantly higher purchase cost than comparable yachts from mass-production companies.  The yacht is available in various degrees of part-completion as well as in factory-finished form. 

Logical Investigations (Husserl)<====>35112946<====>Logical Investigations (Husserl) Logical Investigations ( ) is a work of philosophy by Edmund Husserl, published in two volumes in 1900 and 1901, with a second edition in 1913 and 1921.  In Logical Investigations, which resulted from a shift in Husserl's interests from mathematics to logic and epistemology, Husserl maintains that mathematical laws are not empirical laws that describe the workings of the mind, but ideal laws whose necessity is intuited a priori.  Though Husserl abandoned psychologism, the doctrine according to which logical entities such as propositions, universals, and numbers can be reduced to mental states or activities, in Logical Investigations, some commentators have seen a revival of psychologism in its second volume.

2011 Wisconsin Act 23<====>35113348<====>2011 Wisconsin Act 23 The 2011 Wisconsin Act 23 established a requirement for nearly all voters to present approved photo identification to cast a ballot.  It was one of many new voter ID laws in the United States.  Act 23 was developed by Republican Governor Scott Walker and the Republican controlled Wisconsin Legislature during a walkout by Democratic lawmakers as part of the 2011 Wisconsin protests.Approved forms of identificationSection 1 of Act 23 specifies that only the following forms of photo identification are acceptable: A Wisconsin driver's licenseAn nondriver identification card issued by the Wisconsin Department of TransportationPhoto identification issued by the United States militaryA United States passport or passport cardA United States naturalization certificate, issued not more than two years prior to the electionAn unexpired receipt for a Wisconsin driver's license or nondriver identification card (this is given at the Department of Motor Vehicles, as Wisconsin's licenses and identification cards are printed and mailed from an outstate provider in California) A tribal identification card issued by a recognized Wisconsin Native American tribeAn unexpired identification card issued by an accredited Wisconsin college or university with a date of issuance, a date of expiration not later than two years after the date of issuance, the voter's signature, and further provided that the student also present proof of enrollment in said college or universityImplementationIn July 2011, the Associated Press reported that the Scott Walker administration was planning to close some DMV locations that could issue identification under the voter ID law and increase the hours that other DMVs were available.  The changes were made to comply with a requirement that every county have a DMV location open at least 20 hours per week.  A Democratic legislator said that the closures would occur in primarily Democratic areas, while the expansions would occur in primarily Republican areas.Two weeks later, the plan was replaced with a plan to maintain all existing DMV offices and create four new ones.   In July 2011, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT) sent an internal memo instructing employees that an applicant for an ID card must pay the $28 fee unless the applicant requests that the ID be issued for free.In September 2011, the DMV began posting signs instructing applicants seeking free "ID cards used for voting" to check the appropriate box on the application form.   As initially implemented, an applicant for an identification card was required to present a birth certificate.  The Division of Motor Vehicles maintains form MV3002, which allows identification cards to be issued without a birth certificate.  The form is not mentioned in publicly available materials published by the DMV, and a high-ranking DMV official was unfamiliar with the form.On September 2014, a procedure was implemented where applicants could supply birth information that would be verified with the State Vital Records Office for free. Legal challengesOn December 13, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit Frank v. Walker in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin seeking to block the Act as a violation of the U.S. Constitution.In April 2014, U.S. District Judge Lynn S. Adelman in Milwaukee issued a permanent injunction against the Act, ruling that the Act was unconstitutional as well as a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.    Adelman said that it was not shown that voters without acceptable identification could obtain it under the Act and that the state failed to show evidence of recent voter impersonation fraud.    Adelman's ruling marked that first time that a voter ID law had been found to violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Adelman found a violation of Section 2 on the basis of racial minorities not only being more likely to lack acceptable identification, but also facing additional barriers to acquiring acceptable identification.   In a separate litigation, on July 31, 2014, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Act by giving the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles discretion to waive fees, over dissent by Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, and Justices N. Patrick Crooks and Ann Walsh Bradley. Richard L. Hasen, Softening Voter ID Laws Through Litigation: Is It Enough?, 2016 Wis. L. Rev. Forward 100  The state appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and asked for a stay of Judge Adelman's injunction.On September 12, 2014, the same day oral arguments were held, a Seventh Circuit panel stayed Adelman's injunction, allowing the Act to immediately take effect, and Wisconsin officials announced plans to implement the Act for the November 2014 election.Judge Frank H. Easterbrook was joined by Judges Diane S. Sykes and John Daniel Tinder.   On October 10, an equally divided circuit voted 5-5 to deny rehearing en banc, over written dissent by Judge Richard Posner.  On October 9, 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the stay imposed by the Seventh Circuit, and thus temporarily barred the state from implementing the voter id law, due tothe proximity of the upcoming general election and the fact that absentee ballots were sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted, over written dissent by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.. On March 23, 2015, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari.  On October 19, 2015, Judge Adelman, entered the order denying the injunction.  However, on April, 12, 2016, the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, with Judge Easterbrook finding the plaintiffs could now challenge the law as it had been applied individually.    On July 19, Judge Adelman found that the state was applying the Act unconstitutionally, ordering the state to allow anyone who makes an affidavit of their eligibility to vote in the November general election. On July 29, 2016, in a separate trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in Madison, U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson also found the Act was applied unconstitutionally but ordering more limited oversight.   On August 10, 2016, the Seventh Circuit stayed Judge Adelman’s injunction, leaving in place Judge Peterson’s order. Judge Peterson held a new hearing after reading news reports in The Nation magazine that the state was ignoring his order. On October 13, 2016, Judge Peterson entered an order expanding his oversight but still not permitting voters to swear eligibility by affidavit.   The United States presidential election in Wisconsin, 2016 was held on November 8.In unrelated litigation, on November 21, the Seventh Circuit found Wisconsin Legislature’s 2011 redistricting plan was an unconstitutionally partisan gerrymandering, the first successful claim of partisan gerrymandering in the United States in thirty years.

L1448-IRS2E<====>35122152<====>L1448-IRS2E L1488-IRS2E is an object located in the Perseus star forming region.   A clump of dense gas and dust, L1488-IRS2E is one-tenth as luminous as our sun and thus is unlikely to be a true protostar at this time.   However, its density is high enough that it is ejecting streams of matter from itself, and so it is a likely candidate for the first discovered core in hydrostatic quasi-equilibrium.   This would mean that L1488-IRS2E represents an early phase in stellar development which has so far remained unobserved due to the short time that a star spends in this phase and the low luminosity which comes from a star not yet developed past it.

Retributive justice, the court found, had failed and was failing to stem the wave of crime in South Africa.  It was counter-productive and self-defeating, therefore, to expose first-time offenders to the corrosive and brutalising effect of prison for trifling offences.

Similarly one can define tertiary cohomology operations from the kernel to the cokernel of  secondary operations, and continue like this to define higher cohomology operations, as in  .  Michael Atiyah pointed out in the 1960s that many of the classical applications could be proved more easily using generalized cohomology theories, such as in his reproof of the Hopf invariant one theorem.

Thiamine transporter<====>35131461<====>Thiamine transporter Members of this protein family have been assigned as thiamine transporters by a phylogenomic analysis of families of genes regulated by the THI element, a broadly conserved RNA secondary structure element through which thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) levels can regulate transcription of many genes related to thiamine transport, salvage, and de novo biosynthesis.  Species with this protein always lack the ThiBPQ ABC transporter.  In some species (e. g.  Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pyogenes), yuaJ is the only THI-regulated gene.  Evidence from Bacillus cereus indicates thiamine uptake is coupled to proton translocation. This family includes human solute transporters SLC19A1, SLC19A2 and SLC19A3.

Saccharide transporter<====>35131653<====>Saccharide transporter The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a multi-protein system involved in the regulation of a variety of metabolic and transcriptional processes.  The PTS catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell membrane.  The general mechanism of the PTS is the following: a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is transferred to enzyme-I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr).  Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three structurally distinct domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC)which can either be fused together in a single polypeptide chain or exist as two or three interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

Utility ratemaking<====>35132007<====>Utility ratemakingUtility ratemaking is the formal regulatory process in the United States by which public utilities set the prices (more commonly known as "rates") they will charge consumers.   Ratemaking, typically carried out through "rate cases" before a public utilities commission, serves as one of the primary instruments of government regulation of public utilities. OverviewHistorically, many different classes of business have been classified as public utilities, and thus have been legally mandated to go through the ratemaking process in order to determine the allowable service charges for their industry.  Although the classification of public utilities has changed over time, typically such businesses must constitute a de facto monopoly (or "natural monopoly") for the services they provide within a particular jurisdiction.

Shcramjet<====>35133851<====>Shcramjet A Shock-Induced Combustion Ramjet Engine (abbreviated as Shcramjet; also called Oblique Detonation Wave Engine (ODWE), or simply referred to as Shock-Ramjet Engine) is a concept of air-breathing ramjet engine, proposed to be used for  hypersonic, as well as, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) propulsion applications.   From the overall design point of view, the shcramjet engine is similar to a scramjet engine; however, unlike the diffusive mode of combustion in scramjet engine, a shcramjet engine combustion takes place across a very thin region of standing oblique shock and/or detonation waves stabilized over a wedge, blunt body etc.  Since combustion in a shcramjet engine is confined to very short region across the igniting wave, the combustor length in a shcramjet can be significantly shorter than the scramjet that requires a lengthy combustor for complete fuel-air mixing and combustion.

Turk's head brush<====>35134246<====>Turk's head brushA Turk's head brush is a type of cleaning brush where the bristles are arranged covering the end of the stem as a half-sphere, so that the end of the stem does not come into direct contact with the surface being cleaned, especially when cleaning the inside of a cylindrical object.  A larger type, mounted on a long stem and used for removing cobwebs, is called a Turk's head broom.  The name has long been in use for this type of brush, so named because its cleaning end resembles a "wild" head of hair.   Turk's head brushes and brooms are used for domestic purposes,  for cleaning artillery,  for pharmaceutical use,  for sweeping chimneys,  and for other purposes.

Middle income trap<====>35134341<====>Middle income trapThe middle income trap is a theorized economic development situation, where a country which attains a certain income (due to given advantages) will get stuck at that level.    DynamicsA country in the middle income trap will have lost their competitive edge in the exportation of manufactured goods because their wages are on a rising trend.  However, they are unable to keep up with economically more developed economies in the high-value-added market.  As a result, newly industrialised economies such as South Africa and Brazil have not, for decades, left what the World Bank defines as the 'middle-income range' since their per capita gross national product has remained between $1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices.

Meditatioun In Wyntir<====>35139168<====>Meditatioun In Wyntir Meditatioun In Wyntir is a contemplative poem in Scots by William Dunbar (born 1459 or 1460).  In the work, Dunbar describes how Winter lowers his spirits.  While beset by melancholy and insomnia, he meditates indecisively on thwarted ambition, ageing and mortality, causing him to become depressed.  The approaching end of Winter restores his sense of hope. The poem seems to be inspired by Dunbar's personal experience; his brief reference to dissatisfaction of life "into this court" might be interpreted as referring to the royal court of King James IV. The text is preserved in the Maitland Folio Manuscript.

Q-Vectors<====>35139871<====>Q-VectorsQ-vectors are used in atmospheric dynamics to understand physical processes such as vertical motion and frontogenesis. Q-vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the quasi-geostrophic equations and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations. On meteorological charts, Q-vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion.  Q-vectors are an alternative to the omega equation for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi-geostrophic equations.DerivationFirst derived in 1978,    Q-vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes, using the midlatitude β-plane quasi-geostrophic prediction equations:   \frac{D_g u_g}{Dt} - f_{0}v_a - \beta y v_g = 0   (x component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)  \frac{D_g v_g}{Dt} + f_{0}u_a + \beta y u_g = 0   (y component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)  \frac{D_g T}{Dt} - \frac{\sigma p}{R} \omega = \frac{J}{c_p}   (quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation)And the thermal wind equations:  f_{0} \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial p} = \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}   (x component of thermal wind equation)  f_{0} \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} = - \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}   (y component of thermal wind equation)where  f_0  is the Coriolis parameter, approximated by the constant 1e −4  s −1 ;  R  is the atmospheric ideal gas constant;   \beta   is the latitudinal change in the Coriolis parameter   \beta = \frac{\partial f} {\partial y}  ;   \sigma   is a static stability parameter;  c_p  is the specific heat at constant pressure;  p  is pressure;  T  is temperature; anything with a subscript  g  indicates geostrophic; anything with a subscript  a  indicates ageostrophic;  J  is a diabatic heating rate; and  \omega  is the Lagrangian rate change of pressure with time.  \omega = \frac{Dp}{Dt} .  Note that because pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere, a   - \omega   is upward vertical motion, analogous to  +w=\frac{Dz}{Dt} .From these equations we can get expressions for the Q-vector:  Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right]    Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right]  And in vector form:  Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial x} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T    Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial y} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T  Plugging these Q-vector equations into the quasi-geostrophic omega equation gives:  \left(\sigma \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} + f_{\circ}^2 \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial p^2} \right) \omega = -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} + f_{\circ} \beta \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} - \frac{\kappa}{p} \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} J  Which in an adiabatic setting gives:  -\omega \propto -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q}  Expanding the left-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation in a Fourier Series gives the   -\omega   above, implying that a   -\omega   relationship with the right-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation can be assumed.This expression shows that the divergence of the Q-vector (  \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q}  ) is associated with downward motion. Therefore, convergent   \vec{Q}   forces ascend and divergent   \vec{Q}   forces descend.  Q-vectors and all ageostrophic flow exist to preserve thermal wind balance. Therefore, low level Q-vectors tend to point in the direction of low-level ageostrophic winds. ApplicationsQ-vectors can be determined wholly with: geopotential height (  \Phi  ) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where   \frac{\partial T} {\partial y}  ), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind.  This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.In frontogenesis, temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients.  In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created. References

Siphonopidae<====>35140052<====>Siphonopidae  The Siphonopidae are the family of common caecilians.   They are found in Central and South America.   Like other caecilians, they superficially resemble worms or snakes. They are the sister group to Dermophiidae, also of South America.  Siphonopids are oviparous caecilians, meaning they lay eggs.  They have imperforated stapes and no inner mandibular teeth.  Like species of some other caecilian families, their skulls have relatively few bones, with those present being fused to form a solid ram to aid in burrowing through the soil.

Bed burial<====>35140069<====>Bed burialA bed burial is a type of burial in which the deceased person is buried in the ground, lying upon a bed.   It is a burial custom that is particularly associated with high status women during the early Anglo-Saxon period (7th century), although excavated examples of bed burials are comparatively rare. Anglo-Saxon bed burialsA number of early Anglo-Saxon bed burials, almost all dating to the 7th century, have been found in England, predominantly in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Wiltshire, but single examples have also been found in Derbyshire and North Yorkshire.   The beds used in these burials were made of wood, and although none have been fully preserved, their presence can be inferred from the presence of iron fixtures and fittings, such as nails, cleats, grommets, brackets, headboard mounts and railings, that outline the rectangular shape of the bed in the grave.

Risk and actuarial criminology<====>35140140<====>Risk and actuarial criminology Risk and actuarial criminology, unlike many other theories of crime, does not focus on the causality of crime.  It believes the social world is too complex and interlocking to understand what causes a behaviour or action.  This theory seeks to understand the emerging forms of social control that may lead to crime, and concentrates on assessing risk. Major aspects of this theory are the norms and rules of a society that propel behaviour and private sectors getting involved in citizens lives.  This theory does not revolve around issues of justice, the criminal code, or laws, it focuses on questions of how to minimize risk of entrenchments on private security for the general population.

Usable fuel<====>35140174<====>Usable fuelIn aviation, usable fuel is the fuel on board an aircraft that can actually be used by its engines.  The opposite of usable fuel is unusable fuel.  Websters dictionary on Unusable fuel, visited 19 March, 2012 The unusable fuel figure is calculated for an aircraft fuel tank in "the most adverse fuel feed condition occurring under each intended operation and flight maneuver involving that tank".  The figure usable fuel is used when calculating or defining other key figures of an aircraft such as MTOW, zero-fuel weight etc.  Usable fuel is the total amount of fuel in an aircraft minus the fuel that cannot be fed into the engine(s): fuel under the pump-intake, fuel behind ribs of a tank, fuel in lines between the tanks and the engines etc.

Epilachninae<====>35140434<====>Epilachninae The Epilachninae are a subfamily of the family of lady beetles, the Coccinellidae, in the order Coleoptera.  Superficially, they look much like other ladybirds in the larger subfamily Coccinellinae, but they differ importantly in their biology, in that the members of the subfamily are largely or completely leaf-feeding herbivores rather than being predators.  Accordingly, several members of the subfamily are crop pests, and sometimes cause locally serious crop losses. OverviewThe Epilachninae constitute about 16% of the described species of the Coccinellidae.  Their identification is no problem in the field when examining routine crop damage, because they are selective feeders, but a specimen obtained out of context can be troublesome; their markings are not consistent, so offhand identification is unreliable.

Who's Feeling Young Now?<====>35145198<====>Who's Feeling Young Now? Who's Feeling Young Now? is the third album by Punch Brothers.  The album was released February 14, 2012.   It has been described as "remarkably close to the indie-rock sounds of today" for a bluegrass album.    The album is more accessible than the band's previous work, based on a decision not to over-complicate the music: "instead of adding parts, you’re reinforcing existing parts.

Quantum oscillations (experimental technique)<====>35146189<====>Quantum oscillations (experimental technique) In condensed matter physics, Quantum oscillations describes a series of related experimental techniques used to map the Fermi surface of a metal in the presence of a strong magnetic field.These techniques are based on the principle of Landau quantization of Fermions moving in a magnetic field.For a gas of free fermions in a strong magnetic field, the energy levels are quantized into bands, called the Landau levels, whose separation is inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.  In a quantum oscillation experiment, the external magnetic field is varied, which causes the Landau levels to pass over the Fermi surface, which in turn results in oscillations of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level; this produces oscillations in the many material properties which depend on this, including resistance (the Shubnikov-de Haas effect), Hall resistance,  and magnetic susceptibility (the de Haas-van Alphen effect).

Ryūka<====>35146405<====>Ryūka  is a genre of songs and poetry originating from the Okinawa Islands, Okinawa Prefecture of southwestern Japan.  Most ryūka are featured by the 8-8-8-6 syllable structure. Concepts and classificationThe word ryūka (ruuka in archaic pronunciation   ) was first attested in the Kon-kōken-shū (1711).  The name came into use when Ryūkyū's pechin class in Shuri and Naha embraced Japanese high culture including waka.  It is analogous with the Japanese custom of contrasting Japanese poetry  (waka or yamato-uta) with Chinese poetry (kara-uta).  There is abundant evidence that ryūka was simply referred to as uta (songs and/or poems) in colloquial use.

Autogenic inhibition reflex<====>35151555<====>Autogenic inhibition reflexAutogenic inhibition reflex is a sudden relaxation of muscle upon development of high tension.  It is a self-induced, inhibitory, negative feedback lengthening reaction that protects against muscle tear.  Golgi tendon organs are receptors for the reflex. Autogenic inhibition (historically known as the inverse myotatic reflex or autogenetic inhibition) refers to a reduction in excitability of a contracting or stretched muscle, that in the past has been solely attributed to the increased inhibitory input arising from Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) within the same muscle.  The reduced efferent (motor) drive to the muscle by way of autogenic inhibition is a factor believed to assist target muscle elongation.

Hardgainer<====>35152005<====>Hardgainer A hardgainer is an arbitrary label that describes a person who practices bodybuilding but finds it challenging to develop musculature regardless of the amount of effort put in.  The opposite of a hardgainer is an easygainer.

Cartier duality<====>35152335<====>Cartier dualityIn mathematics,Cartier duality is a analogue of Pontryagin duality for commutative group schemes.  It was introduced by  . Definition using charactersGiven any finite flat commutative group scheme G over S, its Cartier dual is the group of characters, defined as the functor that takes any S-scheme T to the abelian group of group scheme homomorphisms from the base change G T  to G m,T  and any map of S-schemes to the canonical map of character groups.   This functor is representable by a finite flat S-group scheme, and Cartier duality forms an additive involutive antiequivalence from the category of finite flat commutative S-group schemes to itself.

Personal RF safety monitors<====>35152779<====>Personal RF safety monitorsElectromagnetic field densitometers measure the exposure to electromagnetic radiation in certain ranges of theelectromagnetic spectrum.  This article concentrates on densitometers used in the telecommunication industry, which measure exposure to radio spectrum radiation.  Other densitometers, like extremely low frequency densitometers which measure exposure to radiation from electric power lines, also exist.  The major difference between a "Densitometer" and a "Dosimeter" is that a Dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose, which does not exist for RF Monitors.  Monitors are also separated by "RF Monitors" that simply measure fields and "RF Personal Monitors" that are designed to function while mounted on the human body.

Phase-contrast X-ray imaging<====>35154335<====>Phase-contrast X-ray imagingPhase-contrast X-ray imaging (PCI) or phase-sensitive X-ray imaging is a general term for different technical methods that use information concerning changes in the phase of an X-ray beam that passes through an object in order to create its images.  Standard X-ray imaging techniques like radiography or computed tomography (CT) rely on a decrease of the X-ray beam's intensity (attenuation) when traversing the sample, which can be measured directly with the assistance of an X-ray detector.  In PCI however, the beam's phase shift caused by the sample is not measured directly, but is transformed into variations in intensity, which then can be recorded by the detector.

Magnetic lattice (accelerator)<====>35154764<====>Magnetic lattice (accelerator) In accelerator physics, a magnetic lattice is a composition of electromagnets at given longitudinal positions around the vacuum tube of a particle accelerator, and thus along the path of the enclosed charged particle beam.  The lattice properties have a large influence on the properties of the particle beam, which is shaped by magnetic fields.  Lattices can be closed (cyclic accelerators like the synchrotrons), linear (for linac facilities) and are also used at interconnects between different accelerator structures (transfer beamlines). Such a structure is needed for focusing of the particle beam in modern, large-scale facilities.  Its basic elements are dipole magnets for deflection, quadrupole magnets for Strong focusing, sextupole magnets for correction of chromatic aberration, and sometimes even higher order magnets.

Conserved signature indels<====>35155103<====>Conserved signature indelsConserved signature inserts and deletions (CSIs) in protein sequences provide an important category of  molecular markers for understanding phylogenetic relationships.   CSIs, brought about by rare genetic changes, provide useful phylogenetic markers that are generally of defined size and they are flanked on both sides by conserved regions to ensure their reliability.  While indels can be arbitrary inserts or deletions, CSIs are defined as only those protein indels that are present within conserved regions of the protein. The CSIs that are restricted to a particular clade or group of species, generally provide good phylogenetic markers of common evolutionary descent.

Residue curve<====>35156653<====>Residue curveA residue curve describes the change of the composition of the liquid phase of a chemical mixture during continuous evaporation at the condition of vapor–liquid equilibrium (open distillation).  Multiple residue curves for a single system are called residue curves map. Residue curves allow testing the feasibility of a separation of mixtures and therefore are a valuable tool in designing distillation processes.  Residue curve maps are typically used for examining ternary mixtures  which can't be easily separated by distillation because of azeotropic points or too small relative volatilities. CharacteristicsResidue curves start at the composition of a feed and then move to pure components or azeotropic points with higher temperatures (isobaric condition) or lower vapor pressures (isothermal condition).

Load/store architecture<====>35161236<====>Load/store architectureIn computer engineering, a load/store architecture divides instructions into 2 categories: memory access (load and store between memory and registers), and ALU operations (which only occur between registers).RISC systems such as PowerPC, SPARC, RISC-V, ARM or MIPS use the load/store architecture.   For instance, in a load/store approach both operands and destination for an ADD operation must be in registers.  This differs from a register memory architecture (used by CISC designs such as x86) in which one of the operands for the ADD operation may be in memory, while the other is in a register.

Register memory architecture<====>35161367<====>Register memory architectureIn computer engineering a register memory architecture allows operations to be performed on (or from) memory, as well as registers.If the architecture allows all operands to be in memory or in registers, or in combinations, it is called a "register plus memory" architecture.  In a register memory approach one of the operands for ADD operation may be in memory, while the other is in a register.  This differs from a load/store architecture (used by RISC designs such as MIPS) in which both operands for an ADD operation must be in registers before the ADD.

A roof window tends to be larger than a skylight, making it possible to enjoy a wider view of the sky overhead.  In addition, skylights are usually stationary; that is, they cannot be opened and closed.  With some designs of a roof window, it is possible to retract a portion of the glazed panes to allow in fresh air as well as enjoy the natural light.

Benson's algorithm (Go)<====>35169884<====>Benson's algorithm (Go)  In the game Go, Benson's algorithm (named after David B.  Benson) can be used to determine the stones which are safe from capture no matter how many turns in a row the opposing player gets, i. e.  unconditionally alive.    AlgorithmWithout loss of generality, we describe Benson's algorithm for the Black player. Let X be the set of all Black chains and R be the set of all Black-enclosed regions of X.  Then Benson's algorithm requires iteratively applying the following two steps until neither is able to remove any more chains or regions:Remove from X all Black chains with less than two vital Black-enclosed regions in R, where a Black-enclosed region is vital to a Black chain in X if all its empty intersections are also liberties of the chain.

Field effect (semiconductor)<====>35171726<====>Field effect (semiconductor) In physics, the field effect refers to the modulation of the electrical conductivity of a material by the application of an external electric field. In a metal the electron density that responds to applied fields is so large that an external electric field can penetrate only a very short distance into the material.  However, in a semiconductor the lower density of electrons (and possibly holes) that can respond to an applied field is sufficiently small that the field can penetrate quite far into the material.  This field penetration alters the conductivity of the semiconductor near its surface, and is called the field effect.

Ghana News Agency<====>35172241<====>Ghana News AgencyThe Ghana News Agency (GNA) is the official news agency of the country of Ghana.  It was founded in 1957 by Kwame Nkrumah as part of a "network of coercive and partisan institutions," in a concerted effort to present a more favorable view of the country to the outside world and to control the flow of information nationally.   The New York Times reported in 1964 that most of the agency's news came from Reuters (it had "only a few correspondents abroad"); the agency functioned as a gatekeeper in that it disseminated international news to the Ghanaian press, and deleted any international news critical of the Ghanaian leadership immediately, thus preventing such news from reaching the country's newspapers and radio stations.

Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein<====>35172684<====>Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) is a functional analog of ubiquitin found in the prokaryote Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Modification with Pup is called pupylation.  Pup serves the same function as ubiquitin, although the enzymology of ubiquitylation and pupylation is different.  In contrast to the three-step reaction of ubiquitylation, pupylation requires two steps, therefore only two enzymes are involved in pupylation.  Similar to ubiquitin, Pup attaches to specific lysine residues of substrate proteins by forming isopeptide bonds.  It is then recognized by Mycobacterium proteasomal ATPase (Mpa) by a binding-induced folding mechanism  that forms a unique alpha-helix.

WWA was instrumental in passing the act by educating and train activists on a grassroots level.  In 2003, WWA was reborn with a new opportunity to protect additional wild watersheds, intact ecosystems, old-growth forests, important wildlife habitat, and wildlife migration corridors – wild landscapes that truly deserve lasting protection as wilderness.

OriginAtmospheric and oceanographic flows take place over horizontal length scales which are very large compared to their vertical length scale, and so they can be described using the shallow water equations.  The Rossby number is a dimensionless number which characterises the strength of inertia compared to the strength of the Coriolis force.

A stronger version of the conjecture is  that the torsion is bounded in terms of the dimension of the variety and the degree of the number field. Elliptic curvesThe (strong) torsion conjecture has been completely resolved in the case of elliptic curves.    proved uniform boundedness for elliptic curves over the rationals.

Electronic Miscellaneous Document<====>35173625<====>Electronic Miscellaneous DocumentThe Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD) is an International Air Transport Association (IATA) standard for electronically documenting ancillary revenue; that is, all other sales and transactions between airlines and passengers besides electronic tickets.   It is a step toward moving the airline industry to purely electronic transactions in the business-to-consumer context. OverviewThe flaw with electronic tickets is that they only document one very simple type of transaction: a passenger boards a plane at point A and gets off at point B, and the airline charges (1) airfare and (2) taxes.   At the time e-tickets were first implemented in the 1990s, this simple data structure was not a major problem because most airlines still practiced product bundling.

Crinkle crankle wall<====>35173770<====>Crinkle crankle wall A crinkle crankle wall, also known as a crinkum crankum, serpentine, ribbon or wavy wall, is an unusual type of garden wall. The crinkle crankle wall economizes on bricks, despite its sinuous configuration, because it can be made just one brick thin.  If a wall this thin were to be made in a straight line, without buttresses, it would easily topple over.  The alternate   and   curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist   forces. Both crinkle and crankle are defined as something with bends and turns (Webster's), but the term is also thought to come from Old English meaning zig-zag. 

Concerto da camera (Honegger)<====>35173774<====>Concerto da camera (Honegger) Concerto da camera (H 196) is a concerto in three movements for the unusual combination of flute, English horn, and string orchestra written by Arthur Honegger late in his career in 1948.

Lithospheric flexure<====>35175245<====>Lithospheric flexure The lithospheric flexure (also called regional isostasy) is the process by which the lithosphere (rigid outer layer of the Earth) bends under the action of forces such as the weight of a growing orogen or changes in ice thickness related to (de)glaciations.  The lithosphere is a thin, outer, rigid layer of the Earth resting on the asthenosphere, a viscous layer that in geological time scales behaves as a viscous fluid.  Thus, when loaded, the lithosphere progressively reaches an isostatic equilibrium, which is the name of the Archimedes principle applied to these geological settings.    This phenomenon was first described in the late 19th century to explain the shorelines uplifted in Scandinavia due to the removal of large ice massed during the last glaciation.

A scheduling conflict with Louisville's Freedom Hall in 2006 forced the series back to the schools' respective campuses. Of the 55 games between IU and UK, 48 have been played in December. There have been a total of six overtime games in this rivalry series, the most for any non-conference Kentucky rival. The rivalry has been the subject of substantial commentary and media interest. ESPN commentator Dick Vitale said of the rivalry, "Don't you get excited in the world of basketball thinking about Kentucky and Indiana playing? Two Goliaths, two elite programs."  Fellow commentator Eamonn Brennan called it "one of the great nonconference rivalries in the sport, which features the two storied, flagship, blueblood programs from the nation's two most basketball-obsessed states, states which just so happen to share a border."  The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of Indiana and Kentucky. Although the two teams had played every season since 1969, a dispute over whether future games should be played at the schools' respective home courts or at nearby neutral sites led to the cancellation of the game for the 2012–13 season.The Indiana–Kentucky basketball rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams. Remarkably, in 11 of the 56 meetings between Indiana and Kentucky, one of the schools has been ranked number one, which is nearly 20 percent of the meetings. Kentucky has won eight NCAA championships and has appeared in fifteen Final Fours, while Indiana has won five NCAA championships and appeared in eight Final Fours. Combining for thirteen national championships over the last 72 years, Indiana and Kentucky have captured 18% of the national championships, nearly one every five years. Notable story lines of the rivalry also involve major upsets by both teams and high-profile, outspoken coaches, including Bob Knight and Adolph Rupp.High-profile feuds and incidents between the schools programs have fueled the rivalry over the years. Indiana coach Bob Knight would frequently suggest that Kentucky violated NCAA recruiting rules. When asked about the rivalry by Kentucky announcer Cawood Ledford, Knight said, "You know, Cawood, with all the crap that has gone on down here over the years with recruiting and all, these games are not nearly as special to me as you might think."  Referring to UK's reputation for putting less-than-outstanding public citizens on the team, Knight later said, "I like to think of C. M. Newton [University of Kentucky Athletic Director] as the school's director of corrections."  After Knight kicked recruit Lawrence Funderburke off his team, he refused to allow Funderburke to play for Kentucky. When asked about the series in 1999, Knight claimed that it would be fine if the series were returned to the home courts and added, "Pitino complained because we didn't play in Rupp Arena. Rick had a tough time understanding that it was a game between Kentucky and Indiana, not between him and me." Notable games1924: The Indiana Hoosiers and Kentucky Wildcats met for the first time on December 18, 1924 in the second game ever played at the newly opened Alumni Gymnasium on the University of Kentucky campus. Both teams were led by new coaches. The 1-1 Hoosiers were headed by first year coach Everett Dean who would go on to compile a 162-93 record in 14 seasons at Indiana. Clarence Applegran, in his only season at Kentucky, coached a Wildcats team that was 1-0. Characterized in newspaper reports as a defensive game, IU held onto a five-point halftime lead to beat Kentucky 20-18. Indiana would eventually finish the 1924-1925 season 12-5 and the Wildcats 13-8. Alternating between Bloomington, Indiana and Lexington, Kentucky, the teams would meet each of the next three seasons with Indiana a double-digit victor in each game.1940: The Indiana/Kentucky match-up resumed thirteen seasons later at the annual Sugar Bowl tournament in New Orleans before a record crowd of 7,500. Coached by Branch McCracken, the Hoosiers entered the game as the defending national champions with a record of 6-1. McCracken's team, who had just flown in from the West Coast after taking three out of four games from Stanford, California, USC, and UCLA, was described as being air sick. Adolph Rupp, destined to hold the title NCAA Division I men's basketball record-holder for victories, led a 5-2 Kentucky team that won the SEC Men's Basketball Tournament and the Sugar Bowl tournament the previous season. Curly Armstrong and Bill Menke each scored 14 to help Indiana hold off the Wildcats, 48-45.1943 and 1944: After the 1942-1943 season, McCracken took a leave of absence from Indiana University to become a lieutenant in US Navy and was replaced by Harry Good from Indiana Central College who would take over the Indiana team during the war years. The 1943-1944 Hoosiers lost all of their returning lettermen to the armed forces and were left with a team of primarily inexperienced freshmen. Four freshmen starters, including Indiana Mr. Basketball Ed Schienbein, left for the US Navy after IU's first game. After six straight defeats (the series record), Kentucky defeated Indiana 66-41 at Jefferson County Armory in Louisville. Walter Johnson contributed 13 and Bob Brannum 12 points for the Wildcats. The victory would be the first of five straight that Kentucky would hand the Hoosiers, a feat they would duplicate later in the 1990s and the 2000s. Kentucky finished the season 19-2. Described as one of their worst seasons ever, Indiana ended-up 7-15.The two teams met at the same venue one year later. Led by Alex Groza, Wilbur Schu, Jack Tingle, the Kentucky team undefeated in their three previous games posted a 61-43 win over a 4-1 Indiana squad.December 12, 1970: UK 95, IU 93 (OT): Kentucky's overtime win, 95-93, was led by 24 points and 12 rebounds from Tom Parker, 19 points from Kent Hollenback and 18 from Mike Casey. Indiana's George McGinnis scored 38 points and grabbed 20 rebounds.    He had one of the best single performances in this rivalry. This was the final season of play at the Indiana Fieldhouse in Bloomington.December 17, 1971: IU 90, UK 89 (2 OT): In 1971 Bob Knight took the head coaching job at Indiana. His first game against Kentucky went into double overtime with IU winning 90–89. Indiana's Steve Downing scored 47 points (on 19-of-39 shooting) and 25 rebounds in what would be one of the best all-time performances against Kentucky.  From this game until the 1976 season, Indiana would only lose a single game to the Wildcats in seven meetings.March 17, 1973: IU 72, UK 65: This match-up occurred in the NCAA Tournament Mideast Regional Final in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Indiana and Kentucky were programs in transition at the time. Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall was in his first season as the successor to Adolph Rupp, who spent 42 years as Kentucky's coach. Bob Knight was in his second season at Indiana and won the Big Ten outright. IU had won the regular season matchup in Bloomington, and won in Nasvhille as well, making 1972-73 the first and still only time that IU or Kentucky has defeated the other twice in the same season. It was an unusually rough shooting performance for a Knight era team (44 percent), but IU won the game at the free throw line, making 10 free throws to Kentucky's three. Steve Downing led IU with 23 points on 10-22 shooting, and Quinn Buckner added 16. John Laskowski scored 10 points on 4-5 shooting off the bench. The win in the regional final sent IU to the Final Four for the first of five times under Knight and for the first time in 20 years. The Hoosiers went on to lose to eventual NCAA champion UCLA in the national semifinals.December 7, 1974: IU 98, UK 74: On December 7, 1974, Indiana and Kentucky met in the regular season in Bloomington with a 98-74 Indiana win. Near the end of the game, Indiana coach Bob Knight went to the Kentucky bench where the official was standing to complain about a call. Before he left, Knight hit Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall in the back of the head.  UK's assistant coach Lynn Nance, a former FBI agent who was about 6 feet 5 inches, had to be restrained by Hall from hitting Knight. Hall later said, "It publicly humiliated me." .Knight said the slap to the head was something he has done, "affectionately" to his own players for years. "But maybe someone would not like that," he said. "If Joe didn't like it, I offer an apology. I don't apologize for the intent." ... "Hall and I have been friends for a long time," Knight said. "If he wants to dissolve the friendship, that's up to him."  Knight blamed the furor on Hall, noting in his inimitable style, "If it was meant to be malicious, I'd have blasted the fucker into the seats." March 22, 1975: UK 92, IU 90: Following a contentious regular season game, Indiana and Kentucky met in the 1975 NCAA Mideast Regional Final in Dayton, Ohio. Coming into that game, the Hoosiers were on a 34-game winning streak, and the number one ranked team in America. Kentucky was ranked number five. However, Indiana star player Scott May saw limited playing time due to a broken arm in the regular season finale against Purdue. May scored 25 points in the regular season IU-UK meeting, but he managed only 2 points in seven minutes in the Tournament game, which he played with a cast on his left arm. IU surged out to an early seven-point lead before UK rallied to tie it at 44 by halftime. Despite Indiana's Kent Benson scoring 33 points (on 13-of-18 shooting) and grabbing 23 rebounds, Kentucky won 92-90. The loss for Indiana prevented what could have been back-to-back undefeated seasons and national championships as the Hoosiers went on to take the national title in 1976. Bob Knight would later said that this 1974-1975 team was the best he ever coached, even better than the undefeated national champions of 1976. The win put UK in the Final Four in San Diego, where they dropped the NCAA title game in what would be John Wooden's last game. Kentucky's win over Indiana remains as one of the seminal non-title victories in the history of Kentucky basketball. It is on USA Today's list of the greatest NCAA tournament games of all time. December 15, 1979: UK 69, IU 58: In 1979 the number one ranked Indiana traveled to Rupp Arena to take on 5th ranked Kentucky. Indiana, led by future NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, was handed a 69-58 defeat. Kentucky's Kyle Macy scored 12 points while Jay Shidler and Lavon Williams each added 11. Kentucky held IU to just 17 of 49 shooting (34.6 percent) and won the rebounding battle 42-29 with Fred Cowan pulling down 11 rebounds. Isiah Thomas scored 14 but IU's Randy Wittman managed just one point in 22 minutes.March 24, 1983: UK 64, IU 59: This game occurred in the NCAA Tournament Mideast Regional Semifinal. The five banners in the south end of Assembly Hall honor IU's NCAA champions, and the banners in the north end honor various other accomplishments: NIT titles, Final Four appearances, the undefeated regular season of 1976. While there now are two banners listing the years of IU's 20 Big Ten titles, those weren't present during Bob Knight's tenure. Before 2000, the only Big Ten title banner honored the 1983 team, which Knight ordered as a tribute to the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games, over Purdue, Illinois, and Ohio State, to seal the conference title after losing Ted Kitchel to injury. While IU survived the loss of Kitchel in the regular season, in the Tournament, his absence was felt, and IU lost to Kentucky despite strong performances by Randy Wittman and Uwe Blab.December 8, 1984: IU 81, UK 68: Indiana's Steve Alford, as a sophomore, hit 11-of-14 shots from the field and both of his free throw attempts to drop in 24 points in an 81-64 IU victory.  He also had seven assists.December 5, 1987: UK 82, IU 76 (OT): In the inaugural game of the Big 4 Classic, an annual double-header pitting UK, IU, Louisville and Notre Dame, the 5th ranked Hoosiers took on the 2nd ranked Wildcats. Indiana freshman Jay Edwards tied the game at 71-71 on a baseline jumper with :01 showing on the clock to send the game to overtime. In the extra period with UK leading 78-76, goggle-sporting Ed Davender forced Keith Smart into a turnover, Rex Chapman dove on the loose ball and fed it to Richard Madison for a dunk – his only basket of the game – with 34 seconds left to seal the deal. Davender, who finished with 22 points, held Smart to just five points on 2 of 9 shooting. Chapman added 20 and Cedric Jenkins contributed 14 points and 10 rebounds as five Cats reached double figures. Rick Calloway, a 6-6 guard who later transferred to Kansas, scored a game-high 26 for IU.December 2, 1989: IU 71, UK 69: Before 40,128 in the Hoosier Dome, a Kentucky team on probation nearly upset No. 14 Indiana in the first meeting between Bobby Knight and Rick Pitino. The Wildcats led 36-32 at halftime but eventually fell to the Hoosiers, 71-69. Deron Feldhaus scored 32 points for Kentucky while Indiana got 16 points and 10 rebounds from Lawrence Funderburke, whose recruitment by Kentucky under Eddie Sutton had gotten the program in trouble with the NCAA. December 7, 1991: UK 76, IU 74: After two close losses to Indiana by a combined five points, 14th ranked Kentucky beat 9th ranked Indiana 76-74 under coach Rick Pitino. Jamal Mashburn led Kentucky with 21 points and eight rebounds while Deron Feldhaus scored 19 on 5 of 8 shooting beyond the arc. Kentucky managed to overcome a 40-14 margin in free throw attempts heavily favoring the Hoosiers by hitting on 11 of 23 treys. Indiana was 0-for-5 from behind the arc.January 3, 1993: UK 81, IU 78: 4th ranked Indiana traveled to Louisville to take on 3rd ranked Kentucky. Kentucky made 16 of 41 three-pointers as 29 points each for Jamal Mashburn and Travis Ford were canceled out by 29 point games for Indiana's Calbert Cheaney and Matt Nover. Travis Ford's seven three-pointers were the most in a game by a single player in Kentucky history.  Stifling defense by Rodrick Rhodes held Cheaney without a field goal over the final six minutes. Indiana's loss prevented Bob Knight from earning his 600th career victory.December 4, 1993: IU 96, UK 84:   Prior to this game in 1993 Kentucky was ranked number one in the nation, but Indiana upset the Wildcats and earned their first of two wins over a top-ranked UK team. Indiana's Damon Bailey hit 16-of-19 free throws (record for a single game) to score 29 points.  Bailey's performance in the upset earned him a spot on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which has since become an iconic image among Indiana fans. A quote from the accompanying story summarizes the atmosphere that day: Following the win, IU led the all-time series 20-17. But it marked a turning point in the series for a while. From that game until 2011 Kentucky went 14-3 against the Hoosiers.December 7, 1996: UK 99, IU 65: In a 99-65 UK rout, Kentucky's Derek Anderson led all scorers with 30 points while hitting 4-of-9 shots from the three-point line. Anderson also grabbed four rebounds, handed out four assists and pinched three steals.  UK's Ron Mercer scored 26 points on 11-of-18 shooting. He also grabbed six rebounds and had four assists.December 4, 1999: IU 83, UK 75: Kentucky has three five-game winning streaks over IU. Both the 1999 game and the 2005 game prevented UK from winning six in a row. In 1999, senior guards AJ Guyton (21 points, 4-6 from three) and Michael Lewis (17 points, 10-11 from the line) led IU to victory. This was Bob Knight's last IU-UK game, and gave Knight a 15-17 record against UK at IU.December 21, 2002: UK 70, IU 64: Prior to 6th ranked Indiana and 16th ranked Kentucky meeting on December 21, 2002, Indiana coach Mike Davis stated publicly that he "hated Kentucky with a passion" and wanted to win the game "in the worst way." During the game Davis, enraged by a foul not being called, ran wildly onto the court before the game was over. Indiana trailed only 65-64 when Davis exploded, but Kentucky's Keith Bogans made five of the six ensuing free throws to put the game out of reach and Kentucky went on to win the game 70-64.    In a press conference following the game, Mike Davis said, "There's no way I should've acted like that. I can't explain it. I've done something to embarrass my team. ... I cost us the game. I was so emotional. I need to learn and grow from this." December 10, 2011: IU 73, UK 72: In 2011 top-ranked Kentucky traveled to Bloomington to take on unranked Indiana. Indiana fans sensed a resurgence in the program and possible upset, with students lining up outside the arena 10 hours before tipoff to get good seats.  The game remained close and hard-fought, with five lead changes in the final 121 seconds. Indiana star Christian Watford hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer, giving the Hoosiers a stunning 73-72 upset. Victor Oladipo had 13 points and five Hoosiers wound up in double figures. Watford's shot sent Indiana fans storming the court and crowding around players. Kentucky's loss was their only one of the regular season and prevented them from matching a record last set by Indiana's 1975-1976 team.Video of Indiana fans reacting to the shot around the country went viral.  ESPN commentator Dick Vitale, who was covering the game for the network, said it was the "best game of the year"  and that "[t]he atmosphere there was unreal, as I felt the building shaking after Watford hit the shot."  According to Bob Kravitz, the win marked "a day when Hoosier Hysteria was restored to something akin to its former glory." March 23, 2012: UK 102, IU 90: Kentucky was again ranked number one going into the South Regional Semifinals of the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament at Atlanta's Georgia Dome and was matched against #4 seed Indiana, who was responsible for one of UK's two defeats that season.   Led by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (24 points) and Doron Lamb (21 points) and the defense of Anthony Davis (9 points), Kentucky defeated Indiana by a score of 102-90 to advance to the Regional Finals on their way to their eighth NCAA Championship.   End of seriesIn 2011 Kentucky coach John Calipari briefly discussed the possibility of ending one of Kentucky's annual games against rivals Louisville, North Carolina, or Indiana.A last-second shot which propelled Indiana to victory over top-ranked Kentucky and another meeting in the 2012 NCAA Tournament (won by Kentucky) helped re-kindle the rivalry's intensity; however, Calipari and Indiana head coach Tom Crean were unable to resolve the issue of whether to play future games on the respective teams' home courts or at neutral sites. This prompted the schools to cancel their annual meeting for the 2012-13 season.  After IU athletic director Fred Glass reopened negotiations on May 10, 2012, Calipari rejected Glass's compromise to play two games at Lucas Oil Stadium and one game apiece at Assembly Hall and Rupp Arena, thus ending the series.

The first women's basketball game between Indiana and Kentucky was on January 24, 1974 and an 88-54 win for Indiana, the season before Kentucky women's basketball became varsity. The Indiana-Kentucky women's basketball series was played annually on a home-and-home basis from the 1976–77 to 1990–91 seasons, except for the December 30, 1990 game played in Reno, Nevada for the New Year's Classic tournament hosted by the University of Nevada, Reno,and again from 1993–94 to 1997–98.  After that, Kentucky hosted a game against Indiana on November 12, 2006, in which Indiana upset AP-ranked #21 Kentucky 54-51.  As of the 2014–15 season, this remains the final scheduled game in the series, and Indiana leads the series 13–12. BaseballThe first Indiana–Kentucky baseball game took place on April 16, 1903, an 8-5 win for Kentucky. The Indiana–Kentucky baseball series has continued with Kentucky having a 21-18 edge after the 2017 postseason, with one game a year between the schools. ReferencesGeneral   Specific    DEFAULTSORT

A Portrait of Duke Ellington<====>35177874<====>A Portrait of Duke Ellington A Portrait of Duke Ellington is an album featuring trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and orchestra performing compositions associated with Duke Ellington, recorded in 1960 and released on the Verve label.  Dizzy Gillespie discography accessed March 22, 2012  All of the orchestral arrangements were provided by then Hi-Lo's accompanist – and sometimes arranger – Clare Fischer, hired on the basis of a previously recorded but unreleased album with strings, arranged by Fischer for erstwhile University of Michigan classmate Donald Byrd.  Byrd played the tape for Gillespie; Gillespie liked what he heard.  Unfortunately for Fischer, especially in light of the critical accolades given the eventual fruit of his, and Gillespie's, labor, Fischer's name was nowhere to be found on the finished LP;  widespread awareness of his participation would have to await the CD reissue almost 2½ decades later.

Port centric logistics<====>35180846<====>Port centric logistics Port Centric Logistics as a concept in supply chain management has developed since around the turn of the millennium.   Multimodal transport driven container logistics operations typically utilise ocean-going vessels for long-distance movements, with inland movements undertaken by barge, rail or truck.  Conventionally the container is unloaded from the ship at the port and transported to an inland destination by intermodal freight transport.  In the port centric approach, the container is unloaded (or "unstuffed") at the port and its contents are then transported inland e. g.  as palletised freight.  Logistics OptimizationThe port centric approach is not appropriate for all supply chains, but due to the complexities of modern logistics networks it can be difficult to quantify the benefits for each case.

Players of the games are designated as Pokémon Trainers, and the two general goals (in most Pokémon games) for such Trainers are: to complete the Pokédex by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer: the Pokémon Master.

Measurements of neutrino speed<====>35182609<====>Measurements of neutrino speedMeasurements of neutrino speed have been conducted as tests of special relativity and for the determination of the mass of neutrinos.  Astronomical searches investigate whether light and neutrinos emitted simultaneously from a distant source are arriving simultaneously on Earth.  Terrestrial searches include time of flight measurements using synchronized clocks, and direct comparison of neutrino speed with the speed of other particles. Since it is established that neutrinos possess mass, the speed of neutrinos of kinetic energies ranging from MeV to GeV should be slightly lower than the speed of light in accordance with special relativity.

Projective bundle<====>35183882<====>Projective bundleIn mathematics, a projective bundle is a fiber bundle whose fibers are projective spaces. The projective bundle of a vector bundleEvery vector bundle over a variety X gives a projective bundle by taking the projective spaces of the fibers, but not all projective bundles arise in this way: there is an obstruction in the cohomology group H 2 (X,O*).  In particular, if X is a compact Riemann surface, the obstruction vanishes i. e.  H 2 (X,O*)=0. The projective bundle of a vector bundle E is the same thing as the Grassmann bundle  G_1(E)  of 1-planes in E.

Phage major coat protein<====>35185688<====>Phage major coat protein  In molecular biology, a phage major coat protein is an alpha-helical protein that forms a viral envelope of filamentous bacteriophages.  These bacteriophages are flexible rods, about one to two micrometres long and six nm in diameter, with a helical shell of protein subunits surrounding a DNA core.  The approximately 50-residue subunit of the major coat protein is largely alpha-helix, and the axis of the alpha-helix makes a small angle with the axis of the virion.  The protein shell can be considered in three sections: the outer surface, occupied by the N-terminal region of the subunit and rich in acidic residues that give the virion a low isoelectric point; the interior of the shell (including a 19-residue stretch of apolar side-chains) where protein subunits interact, mainly with each other; and the inner surface (occupied by the C-terminal region of the subunit), rich in positively charged residues that interact with the DNA core.

Future Airborne Capability Environment<====>35186455<====>Future Airborne Capability EnvironmentFuture Airborne Capability Environment (FACE™) ConsortiumThe Open Group FACE Consortium was formed in 2010 to define an open avionics environment for all military airborne platform types. Today, it is a real-time software-focused professional group made up of industry suppliers, customers, academia, and users. The FACE approach is a government-industry software standard and business strategy for acquisition of affordable software systems that promotes innovation and rapid integration of portable capabilities across programs. The FACE Consortium provides a vendor-neutral forum for industry and government to work together to develop and consolidate the open standards, best practices, guidance documents, and business strategy necessary to result in: •	Standardized approaches for using open standards within avionics systems •	Lower implementation costs of FACE systems •	Standards that support a robust architecture and enable quality software development •	The use of standard interfaces that will lead to reuse of capabilities •	Portability of applications across multiple FACE systems and vendors •	Procurement of FACE conformant products •	More capabilities reaching the customer faster •	Innovation and competition within the avionics industry The FACE Technical Standard is an open real-time standard for making safety-critical computing operations more robust, interoperable, portable and secure. Although the consortium started with a focus on avionics, the applicability of the technical standard and its associated data model have become much broader. The standard enables software developers to create and deploy a wide catalog of applications for use across the entire spectrum of real-time systems through a common operating environment. The latest edition of the standard further promotes application interoperability and portability with enhanced requirements for exchanging data among FACE components, including a formally specified data model, and emphasis on defining common language requirements for the standard.All FACE Consortium business and technical materials published by The Open Group are available to download free of charge.  BackgroundThe FACE effort sprang from US Navy open architecture programs,  promoted by the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), to enhance interoperability and software portability for avionics software applications across DoD aviation platforms. NAVAIR is leading the pack with FACE acquisitions.  The FACE Consortium was formed by The Open Group as a "Voluntary Consensus Standards Body", as defined by the National Technology Transfer Act and OMB Circular A-119.  This facilitates government participation in the consortium.   One goal of the effort is to reduce the typical development and deployment cycle of new capabilities in military airborne platforms from as long as six years under the current methodology to as little as six months.  The FACE reference architecture ecosystem includes software product conformance verification and certification processes.    In October 2016, a suite of flight management software earned the first FACE certificate of compliance.    One may view information on all certified FACE conformant products at the FACE RegistryReferences
